From its formation in 1916 as part of the Australian Flying Corps, it has flown a variety of aircraft types including fighters, bombers, and Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C).  During World War I, the squadron operated on the Western Front conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions.  It was disbanded in mid-1919, following the end of hostilities.  The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF, but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937.  It saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and, equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.  The squadron was again disbanded in 1982, following the retirement of the Canberra.  It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C \"Wedgetail\".  One of the six Boeing 737s was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS.

It was the first of their designs to be built in quantity.  Unlike the Model A, it featured a true elevator carried at the tail rather than at the front.  It was the last Wright model to have an open-frame tail.  The Model B was a dedicated two-seater with the pilot and a passenger sitting side-by-side on the leading edge of the lower wing. [PAR] [TLE] Wright brothers [SEP] The Wright brothers, Orville (August 19, 1871 – January 30, 1948) and Wilbur (April 16, 1867 – May 30, 1912), were two American brothers, inventors, and aviation pioneers who are generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful airplane.  They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft on December 17, 1903, four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.  In 1904–05 the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft.  Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible. ",

        "injected_context": "[PAR] [TLE] Trogloxene [SEP] Trogloxenes, also called cave guests, are animal species which live close to caves or at the very entrance of the cave, but cannot live exclusively in a cave.  This group consists of both extant animals, such as raccoons, rats, foxes and bears, opiliones (a.k.a. Daddy-Long-Legs) and extinct animals like cave bears, cave lions, cave leopards, and cave hyenas.  Indications trusted by geologists and archaeologists combine to show that these animals lived there in the latter part, at least, of the third interglacial epoch, and on through the fourth and last glacial advance, when, although central Europe was free from an ice cap, an almost Arctic climate prevailed, with much rain.  This is what is known as the Upper Paleolithic, when humanity in Europe was represented by the Neanderthals.
